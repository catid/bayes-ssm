# bayes-ssm

Production dense Bayesian sequence layers for large-model training. This repository contains the Bayesian Layer equations, the ReplaySSM checkpoint/replay boundary, and the validated associative CUDA scan for the static identity-transition case.

## Research

The implementation follows **[Memory by Design: Bayesian Layers for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.31163)** (Dowling, Jeon, Savin, and Park). The hand-cleaned paper conversion is [docs/MemoryByDesign_2605.31163.md](docs/MemoryByDesign_2605.31163.md).

The package keeps recurrent state, covariance, reductions, and scan solves in FP32. It accepts BF16/FP8 projection outputs at the state boundary. `ReplaySSM` provides exact dense covariance with Mamba-style chunk replay for backward.

## Associative CUDA scan

`associative_static_bayesian_cuda` uses CUDA prefix accumulation in information form followed by batched Cholesky solves. It is mathematically valid for `A=I` and `Q=0`; the API rejects observation variances below the denominator floor instead of silently changing the recurrence.

Final GB300 measurements are in [benchmarks/associative_scan_gb300.json](benchmarks/associative_scan_gb300.json). The scan benchmark is [benchmarks/benchmark_replay_scan_cuda.py](benchmarks/benchmark_replay_scan_cuda.py).

| Shape | Dense reference | Associative CUDA scan | Speedup | Max abs. error | Cosine |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| B1 × T16 × D4 × M4 | 21.71 ms | 1.04 ms | 20.9× | 7.2e-7 | 1.0000001 |
| B4 × T64 × D16 × M16 | 218.28 ms | 1.00 ms | 218.8× | 6.7e-6 | 1.0 |

These are CUDA forward timings, not end-to-end optimizer-step measurements. The current prototype uses optimized PyTorch CUDA operations rather than a handwritten `.cu` extension.
